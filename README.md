# ArrivingInBerlin
The Arriving in Berlin App is a digital map containing helpful information for refugees and newcomers to Berlin. Developed by Haus der Kulturen der Welt and Refugees on Rails, kindly supported by the Friends of Haus der Kulturen der Welt.

The app is based on the mapping project “Arriving in Berlin” – A map made by refugees” by Haus Leo (Berliner Stadtmission) and Haus der Kulturen der Welt. It is part of the initiative Berlin Mondiale.

The app provides you with important and interesting places and information on a practical map: language courses, advice centers, doctors, free WiFi networks, and much more.

The information is translated into 6 languages: Arabic, German, English, Farsi, French, Sorani

Offline mode: You can download the map and also use it in offline mode. (Map material: open street maps, Berlin zone AB)
